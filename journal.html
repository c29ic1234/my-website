		<br>
		I'm about a month late for my first journal entry...I've been working on publishing my website, which it finally is, so now I need to write stuff for my journal page. Next, I probably should add some projects. I'll make something else Winnie-the-Pooh themed, if that doesn't end up being too hard. 
	</div>

	<div id="entry2">Journal Entry 2: 11/20/25
		<br>
		We started learning about event listeners today and they don't make a ton of sense right now, but molly says it will all become clear. Java script is weird but it's also cool.  
	</div>

	<div id="entry3">Journal Entry 3: 11/24/25
		<br>
		Molly was out today so Charlie was our sub and we did this java script coding program on a website, which was cool. The java script functions and things like that made more sense laid out on the website since it was super clear what did what. There was a paywall after like 10 mins though  
	</div>

	<div id="entry4">Journal Entry 4: 12/4/25
		<br>
		Molly just scared me a bit by saying if I don't update this website I might get a bad grade when she puts in semester grades so now I am locking in. I need to finish these journal entries, then I need to attatch all my other projects. hopefully I can finish it during class since I have a ton of hw but such is life. I just uploaded 4 projects: my event listener, my thanksgiving turkey, my screaming goat, and my winnie the pooh animation so we are good to go now.   
	</div>

	<div id="entry5">Journal Entry 5: 12/11/25
		<br>
		We're joining this other comp sci class today because Molly's not here and we're making holiday cards. Now I'm trying to figure out event listeners. 

</div>

	<div id="entry6">Journal Entry 6: 1/12/26
		<br>
		I (finally!) got my website online after meeting with New Lab, so now we're making confetti and we learned this new JavaScript command called "append child". Victoria and I thought that was funny. 

	</div>

	<div id="entry7">Journal Entry 7: 1/22/26
		<br>
		We kept working on our confetti projects, and we learned how to rotate the confetti pieces and animate them more smoothly. I added confetti.html onto my projects page.
